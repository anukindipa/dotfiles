## Some Things

### Shell
I use fish as my shell\
i use a framework called [oh my fish]("https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish") with the theme of [bobthefish]()\
To set it up install omf and run ```omf theme bobthefish```\
To get back to the normal shell run ```omf theme ''```\
move  ```omf/themes``` folder to ```~/.local/share/omf/```
